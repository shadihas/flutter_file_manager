# flutter_file_manager

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

To run the project please run :
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs 

# No need for the readme file because everything is self-explanatory just a few things to take into considerations:

 - the things that I implemented during this day:
  1- the app runs on Android only because I currently using windows.
  2- testing is well implemented but there are still some cases to be discussed and units to be tested.
